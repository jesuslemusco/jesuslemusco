## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jesus Lemus, a Platform Engineer. I enjoy building the foundational infrastructure that empowers software development teams by creating internal developer platforms (IDPs), CI/CD frameworks, and overall, a great developer experience (DevEx).

Throughout my career, I have designed and implemented core CI/CD frameworks that power the mobile applications and data pipelines for some of the world's most recognized brands, directly impacting how millions of users receive content. My work also includes architecting infrastructure for major companies. I actively contribute to enhancing engineering workflows, developing automated solutions and integrations that boost developer velocity and reliability across large technical organizations.

My goal is to bridge the gap between infrastructure and development, building resilient platforms and tools that empower engineering teams to innovate and deliver value with speed and confidence.
