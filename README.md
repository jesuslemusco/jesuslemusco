Hello there! I'm Jesus. ðŸ‘‹

I'm a platform engineer from Colombia.

I've built foundational infrastructure that empowers software development teams by:
- Reducing long pipeline waiting hours.
- Less infrastructure headaches so devs can focus on what they do best.
- Pro-active alerting (Less Late On-call shifts for developers)
- End-to-End CICD standards for entire organizations.

I'm now working as contractor platform engineer.
